## DevFest Triangle

DevFest Triangle 2019 is a community-led, developer event hosted by GDG(Google Developer Group) Triangle, focused on community building and learning about Googleâ€™s technologies. Each DevFest is inspired by and uniquely tailored to the needs of the developer community and region that hosts it.

### Time: 8:30 AM - 5:30 PM EDT

## What will we be doing?

In this edition we are joining efforts with Developers @ RTP, an awesome sister community full of amazing people and unique talents. We are hosting a joint event, and we are adding an "unconference" format to empower our own local talent to enter into public speaking whatever their background. With this, we foster our own community participation into public speaking without the pressure of CFP's (Call for papers) and give the opportunity to all our attendants who want to begin sharing their knowledge and discoveries in a safe and friendly environment. NO STRESS!

## Hackathon

Our theme this year is: "Walking through space and time" and we will encourage attendees to create solutions that adjust to the theme using the following tools:

- Google Maps
- Firebase (hosting, functions, database, etc) - Google Cloud Platform if Applicable
- Framework of your choice (Web/Mobile)
- Twillio if Applicable (for SMS/Calls)

## What about food?

There will be a breakfast, coffee breaks and lunch provided at the event and lots of fun people to meet!!!
